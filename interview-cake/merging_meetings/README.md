**Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.**

To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as an array of integers [start_time, end_time]. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

For example:

```ruby
[2, 3]  # meeting from 10:00 – 10:30 am
[6, 9]  # meeting from 12:00 – 1:30 pm
```

Write a method `merge_ranges()` that takes an array of multiple meeting time ranges and returns an array of condensed ranges.

For example, given:

```
[[0, 1], [3, 5], [4, 8], [10, 12], [9, 10]]
```

your method would return:

```
[[0, 1], [3, 8], [9, 12]]
```

**Do not assume the meetings are in order.** The meeting times are coming from multiple teams.

**Write a solution that's efficient even when we can't put a nice upper bound on the numbers representing our time ranges.** Here we've simplified our times down to the number of 30-minute slots past 9:00 am. But we want the method to work even for very large numbers, like Unix timestamps. In any case, the spirit of the challenge is to merge meetings where `start_time` and `end_time` don't have an upper bound.
