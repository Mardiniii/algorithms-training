## Inflight Entertainment

You've built an inflight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

Write a method that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and an array of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum equals flight_length.

When building your method:

- Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
- Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
- Optimize for runtime over memory
