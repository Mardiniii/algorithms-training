**I like parentheticals (a lot).**

"Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing."

Write a method that, given a sentence like the one above, along with the position of an opening parenthesis, finds the corresponding closing parenthesis.

Example: if the example string above is input with the number 10 (position of the first parenthesis), the output should be 79 (position of the last parenthesis).
