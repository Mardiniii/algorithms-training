## Permutation Palindrome

Write an efficient method that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.

You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters.

Examples:

- `"civic"` should return `true`
- `"ivicc"` should return `true`
- `"civil"` should return `false`
- `"livci"` should return `false`

```
"But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"

If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
