## Reverse words

You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a method reverse_words!() that takes a message as a string and reverses the order of the words in place.

For example:

```ruby
message = 'cake pound steal'

reverse_words!(message)

puts message
# prints: 'steal pound cake'
```

When writing your method, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
