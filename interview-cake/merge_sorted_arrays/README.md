## Merge Sorted Arrays

**In order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge our Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit.**

Each order is represented by an "order id" (an integer).

We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in arrays. Write a method to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

For example:

```ruby
my_array     = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15]
alices_array = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19]

puts merge_arrays(my_array, alices_array)
# prints [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
```
