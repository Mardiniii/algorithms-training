**Hooray! It's opposite day. Linked lists go the opposite way today.**

Write a method for reversing a linked list. Do it in place. â†´

Your method will have one input: the head of the list.

Your method should return the new head of the list.

Here's a sample linked list node class:

```ruby
class LinkedListNode
  attr_accessor :value, :next

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @next  = nil
  end
end
```
