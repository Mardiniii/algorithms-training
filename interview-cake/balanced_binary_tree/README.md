**Write a method to see if a binary tree â†´ is "superbalanced" (a new tree property we just made up).**

A tree is "superbalanced" if the difference between the depths of any two leaf nodes is no greater than one.

Here's a sample binary tree node class:

```ruby
class BinaryTreeNode
  attr_accessor :value
  attr_reader :left, :right

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @left  = nil
    @right = nil
  end

  def insert_left(value)
    @left = BinaryTreeNode.new(value)
  end

  def insert_right(value)
    @right = BinaryTreeNode.new(value)
  end
end
```
