# Quicksort - Sorting Algorithm

**Big O:**
  - *Worst case:* O(log n) - When a sorted array is passed and the first or last element are selected as the first pivot.
  - *Average case:* O(n log n) - When a not sorted array is passed and the pivo is ramdonly chosen.

Quicksort sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. If you always choose a random element in the array as the pivot, quicksort will complete in O(n log n) time on average. Quicksort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms out there, and itâ€™s a very good example of D&C.

## Implementations:

- [Ruby](ruby/quicksort.rb)
- [JavaScript](javascript/quicksort.js)
